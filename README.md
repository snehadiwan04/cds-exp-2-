# Experiment 2
## Aim-
write a C++ program that determines the size of different data types.

## Theory-
Understanding the size of various data types is crucial for memory management and optimization in programming. 
Different data types (e.g., int,short int,long int,float, double,long double,bool,char) occupy different amounts of memory.
and checking of size of some data types given by user.

## Explanation - 
The program uses the sizeof operator to determine and display the size of various data types in bytes. It includes common data types such as int, float, double, char, and others.

## Conclusion - 
This program helps in understanding how much memory is allocated for different data types, which is important for writing efficient and optimized code.
